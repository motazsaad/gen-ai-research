# Prompt Design & Idea Generation

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class GenAI exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

## Prompt Design

While it is easy to get started using Generative AI tools, it takes time and practice to get the best results out of Generative AI tools. Here are some key principles to keep in mind as you create your own prompts:
- **Be Clear** & concise in your language to avoid ambiguity:
  - Poor: "Weather?"
  - Better: "What is the current weather in Toronto, Canada?
- **Provide Specific details** to guide the AI toward the desired response.
  - 
- Context: Include relevant context to help the AI understand the prompt better.
- Instruction: Clearly state what you want the AI to do (e.g., "Explain," "Summarize," "Generate").
- Tone: Set the tone of the response you expect (e.g., formal, informal, humorous).
Test and Iterate: Experiment with different variations of your prompt to see which yields the best results.
Feedback Loop: Use the AI's responses to refine your prompts for better accuracy.
Avoid Bias: Be mindful of language that could introduce bias or lead to undesirable outputs.
Consider Audience: Tailor your prompts to the intended audience for the response.
Use Examples: Incorporate examples or analogies to clarify complex concepts.
Limit Scope: Keep the prompt focused on a specific topic or task to prevent overly broad responses.
Sequence Matters: The order of information in your prompt can influence the response, so structure it logically.
Prompt Chaining: Use the output of one prompt as the input for another to build on responses or refine results.
Leverage Precedents: Incorporate elements of successful prompts you've used in the past.

1. Rows, columns, and cells defined:   
   - Columns are vertical. Eg. **Column C.**
   - Rows are horizontal. Eg. **Row 3.**
