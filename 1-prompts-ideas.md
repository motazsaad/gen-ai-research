# Prompt Design & Idea Generation
<img src="images/prompt-design-image.png" style="float:right;width:320px;height:320px;" alt="A student at a computer learning effective GenAI prompt design">
If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class GenAI exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

## Prompt Design
### Prompt Design Basics
While it is easy to get started using Generative AI tools, it takes time and practice to get the best results out of Generative AI tools. 
Here are some key principles to keep in mind as you create your own prompts:
1. **Be Clear & concise** in your language to avoid ambiguity:
  - Poor: "Weather?"
  - Better: "What is the current weather in Victoria, BC, Canada?
2. **Provide Specific details** to guide the AI toward the desired response:
  - Poor: "Tell me about the weather."
  - Better: "Provide a detailed weather forecast in 500 words or less, for Victoria, BC, Canada, for the next three days, including temperature, precipitation, and wind speed."
3. Include **relevant Context** & **Instruction** to help the AI understand the prompt better:
  - Poor: "Tell me about the weather."
  - Better: "I am a teacher teaching grade 2 students about the weather. Please generate a lesson plan for a one-hour lesson about weather including a 30-minute activity to help students remember what they learned in the instruction portion of the lesson."

### Let's Practice!

1. If you haven't already, please [**open Microsoft Copilot**](https://copilot.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"}. If you are a UVic student you can use a version of Copilot licensed for you by UVic by logging on with your UVic email address (e.g. noahsmith@uv.c.ca). The UVic version of Copilot runs on servers located in Canada and does not share any of the prompts you create, or resulting data for training purposes, which is great from a privacy perspective. 
> Note: You are free to use other GenAI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/){:target="_blank"} for this workshop, but you will either have to create accounts for these services if you have not already done so, and will need to take extra steps to preserve your privacy_.
2. Test a poor prompt to start with. Copy and paste the following text into your GenAI tool and note the results:<br>
```Tell me about the weather.```<br>
<br><img src="images/prompt-lesson-poor.png"  alt="An image of Copilot with a weather poor weather prompt example"><br>
  - What are the results from this prompt telling you?
3. Now let's try a prompt that includes more details relevant to the hypothetical help we need by copy and pasting the following text into Copilot:<br>
```I am a teacher teaching grade 2 students about the weather. Please generate a lesson plan for a one-hour lesson about weather including a 30-minute activity to help students remember what they learned in the instruction portion of the lesson.```<br>
<br><img src="images/1-prompt-weather-lesson.png"  alt="An image of Copilot with a weather lesson prompt example"><br>
  - How does the response to this prompt differ from the "poor" prompt above?
  - Do you have the weather-related expertise to determine if the weather-related facts are accurate?
  - Do you have the teaching expertise to know if the lesson plan is reasonable and will work well with grade 2 students?
> Note: every time we use GenAI tools we should ask ourselves whether or not we have the expertise to evaluate the accuracy of the GenAI generated text, because as we know it is not always accurate or factual.
4. Pick a topic that you know a lot about and then ask Microsoft Copilot the question and then verify if the answer is accurate.
   - How did it do?

### Advanced Prompt Design Tips & Tricks
Please practice each of these following skills by either trying out the poor and better prompts to see what the different output looks like. Even better would be to take inspiration from the prompts below and modify them to use topics that you are interested in, or know a lot about so that you can check the responses for accuracy: 
4. Set the **Tone of the response** you would like (e.g., formal, informal, humorous):
  - Poor: "Weather in Paris."
  - Better: "Give me a lighthearted weather update for Paris, France, with a humorous twist."
5. **Incorporate examples** or analogies to clarify complex concepts:
  - Poor: "Explain cyclones."
  - Better: "Explain how cyclones form, using the example of Cyclone Nisarga."
6. **Limit Scope** to focus on a specific topic or task to prevent overly broad responses:
  - Poor: "Tell me everything about weather."
  - Better: "Provide an overview of the factors that influence the formation of thunderstorms."
7. **Test and Iterate** by experimenting with different variations of your prompt to see which yields the best results:
  - Initial: "Weather in London."
  - Refined: "What is the weather forecast for London, UK, for the upcoming weekend, including any weather warnings?"
9. **Prompt Chaining** by using the output of one prompt as the input for another to build on responses or refine results:
  - First Prompt: "What are the key factors that affect local weather conditions?"
  - Second Prompt (using first response): "Considering those factors, what is the likely weather forecast for San Francisco next week?"
10. **Leverage Precedents** by incorporating elements of successful prompts you've used in the past:
  - Previous Successful Prompt: "Explain the concept of **El Niño** and its impact on global weather patterns."
  - New Prompt (leveraging precedent): "Explain the concept of **La Niña** and its impact on global weather patterns."
