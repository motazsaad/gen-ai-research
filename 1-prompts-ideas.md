# Prompt Design & Idea Generation

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class GenAI exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

## Prompt Design Basics
While it is easy to get started using Generative AI tools, it takes time and practice to get the best results out of Generative AI tools. 
Here are some key principles to keep in mind as you create your own prompts:
1. **Be Clear** & concise in your language to avoid ambiguity:
  - Poor: "Weather?"
  - Better: "What is the current weather in Victoria, BC, Canada?
2. **Provide Specific details** to guide the AI toward the desired response:
  - Poor: "Tell me about the weather."
  - Better: "Provide a detailed weather forecast in 500 words or less, for Victoria, BC, Canada, for the next three days, including temperature, precipitation, and wind speed."
3. Include **relevant Context** & **Instruction** to help the AI understand the prompt better:
  - Poor: "Tell me about the weather."
  - Better: "I am a teacher teaching grade 2 students about the weather. Please generate a lesson plan for a one-hour lesson about weather including a 30-minute activity to help students remember what they learned in the instruction portion of the lesson."

## Advanced Prompt Design Tips & Tricks
4. Set the **Tone of the response** you would like (e.g., formal, informal, humorous):
  - Poor: "Weather in Paris."
  - Better: "Give me a lighthearted weather update for Paris, France, with a humorous twist."
7. **Incorporate examples** or analogies to clarify complex concepts:
  - Poor: "Explain cyclones."
  - Better: "Explain how cyclones form, using the example of Cyclone Nisarga."
8. Limit Scope to focus on a specific topic or task to prevent overly broad responses:
  - Poor: "Tell me everything about weather."
  - Better: "Provide an overview of the factors that influence the formation of thunderstorms."
9. Test and Iterate: Experiment with different variations of your prompt to see which yields the best results:
  - 
9. Sequence Matters: The order of information in your prompt can influence the response, so structure it logically.
10. Prompt Chaining: Use the output of one prompt as the input for another to build on responses or refine results.
11. Leverage Precedents: Incorporate elements of successful prompts you've used in the past.

1. Rows, columns, and cells defined:   
   - Columns are vertical. Eg. **Column C.**
   - Rows are horizontal. Eg. **Row 3.**
