## Test GPT4All by Asking Questions You Know the Answers To
1. If you haven't already, please [**open Microsoft Copilot**](https://copilot.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"}. If you are a UVic student you can use a version of Copilot licensed for you by UVic by logging on with your UVic email address (e.g. _noahsmith@uvic.ca_). The UVic version of Copilot runs on servers located in Canada and does not share any of the prompts you create with Microsoft, or resulting data for training data, which is great from a privacy perspective. 
> Note: You are free to use other GenAI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/){:target="_blank"} for this workshop, but you will either have to create accounts for these services if you have not already done so, and will need to take extra steps to preserve your privacy.
2. Test a poor prompt to start with. Copy and paste the following text into your GenAI tool and note the results:<br>
```Tell me about the weather.```<br>
