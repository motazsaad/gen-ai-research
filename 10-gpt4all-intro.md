If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class GenAI exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

## Installing GPT4All on Your Laptop
While it is easy to get started using Generative AI tools, it takes time and practice to get the best results out of Generative AI tools. 
Here are some key principles to keep in mind as you create your own prompts:
1. **Be Clear & concise** in your language to avoid ambiguity:
  - Poor: "Weather?"
  - Better: "What is the current weather in Victoria, BC, Canada?
2. **Provide Specific details** to guide the AI toward the desired response:
  - Poor: "Tell me about the weather."
  - Better: "Provide a detailed weather forecast in 500 words or less, for Victoria, BC, Canada, for the next three days, including temperature, precipitation, and wind speed."
3. Include **relevant Context** & **Instruction** to help the AI understand the prompt better:
  - Poor: "Tell me about the weather."
  - Better: "I am a teacher teaching grade 2 students about the weather. Please generate a lesson plan for a one-hour lesson about weather including a 30-minute activity to help students remember what they learned in the instruction portion of the lesson."

## Test GPT4All by Asking Questions You Know the Answers To
1. If you haven't already, please [**open Microsoft Copilot**](https://copilot.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"}. If you are a UVic student you can use a version of Copilot licensed for you by UVic by logging on with your UVic email address (e.g. _noahsmith@uvic.ca_). The UVic version of Copilot runs on servers located in Canada and does not share any of the prompts you create with Microsoft, or resulting data for training data, which is great from a privacy perspective. 
> Note: You are free to use other GenAI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/){:target="_blank"} for this workshop, but you will either have to create accounts for these services if you have not already done so, and will need to take extra steps to preserve your privacy.
2. Test a poor prompt to start with. Copy and paste the following text into your GenAI tool and note the results:<br>
```Tell me about the weather.```<br>
<br><img src="images/prompt-lesson-poor.png"  alt="An image of Copilot with a weather poor weather prompt example"><br>
  - What are the results from this prompt telling you?
3. Now let's try a prompt that includes more details relevant to the hypothetical help we need by copying and pasting the following text into Copilot:
<br>```I am a teacher teaching grade 2 students about the weather. Please generate a lesson plan for a one-hour lesson about weather including a 30-minute activity to help students remember what they learned in the instruction portion of the lesson. Please provide sources.```<br>
<br><img src="images/1-prompt-weather-lesson.png"  alt="An image of Copilot with a weather lesson prompt example"><br>
>  - **How does the response to this prompt differ from the "_poor_" prompt above?**
>  - **Do you have the weather-related expertise to determine if the weather-related facts are accurate?**
>  - **Do you have the teaching expertise to know if the weather lesson plan is reasonable and will work well with grade 2 students?**
> <br>_Note: every time we use GenAI tools we should ask ourselves whether or not we have the expertise to evaluate the accuracy of GenAI-generated text, because as we know they are not always accurate or factual._
4. Pick one or two topics that you know a lot about (e.g. ```What are the origins of skateboarding?```).
  - **Ask Microsoft Copilot a question about one of the topics.**
  - **Is the answer accurate?**
  - **Can you make it more accurate with follow-up prompts?**
  - **Ask Copilot a question about your second topic.**
  - **How did it do for each topic?**
     - **Was it completely accurate?**
     - **Did you have to research to verify any of the claims Copilot made?**
