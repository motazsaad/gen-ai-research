If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class GenAI exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

## Installing GPT4All on Your Laptop
GPT4All is "a free-to-use, locally running, privacy-aware Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot" ([GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html){:target="_blank"}, 2024).

1. **Be Clear & concise** in your language to avoid ambiguity:
  - Poor: "Weather?"
  - Better: "What is the current weather in Victoria, BC, Canada?
2. **Provide Specific details** to guide the AI toward the desired response:
  - Poor: "Tell me about the weather."
  - Better: "Provide a detailed weather forecast in 500 words or less, for Victoria, BC, Canada, for the next three days, including temperature, precipitation, and wind speed."
3. Include **relevant Context** & **Instruction** to help the AI understand the prompt better:
  - Poor: "Tell me about the weather."
  - Better: "I am a teacher teaching grade 2 students about the weather. Please generate a lesson plan for a one-hour lesson about weather including a 30-minute activity to help students remember what they learned in the instruction portion of the lesson."

## Test GPT4All by Asking Questions You Know the Answers To
1. If you haven't already, please [**open Microsoft Copilot**](https://copilot.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"}. If you are a UVic student you can use a version of Copilot licensed for you by UVic by logging on with your UVic email address (e.g. _noahsmith@uvic.ca_). The UVic version of Copilot runs on servers located in Canada and does not share any of the prompts you create with Microsoft, or resulting data for training data, which is great from a privacy perspective. 
> Note: You are free to use other GenAI tools like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/){:target="_blank"} and [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/){:target="_blank"} for this workshop, but you will either have to create accounts for these services if you have not already done so, and will need to take extra steps to preserve your privacy.
2. Test a poor prompt to start with. Copy and paste the following text into your GenAI tool and note the results:<br>
```Tell me about the weather.```<br>
