# Search for Papers (literature reviews)

If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this in-class GenAI exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

## Perplexity - Summarizes Findings from Top 4 Articles
Perplexity AI is a research assistant tool that leverages natural language processing to answer questions and provide summaries from a wide range of sources. It aims to make information more accessible and understandable, assisting users in exploring topics and finding relevant insights. Don’t depend on the summaries being 100% accurate!

1. Let's do a search in Perplexity on the same topic this time using more natural language.
  - Open [Perplexity]([https://elicit.com/](https://www.perplexity.ai/)){:target="_blank"}, and if you want to use it you'll need to create an account.
  - Type the following into the search bar and press Enter on your keyboard:
<br>```How useful is informal credentialling for academic makerspace skills in student job searches?```<br>
2. Reflection time:
>  - How useful do the articles look informal credentialling for academic makerspace skills in student job searches?
>  - Does the combined 4 article summary look reasonable?
>  - How can you verify the accuracy of the summary?
>  - Does this look like a tool that could help you with your research?

## ResearchRabbit - Make Connections from Groups of Articles
ResearchRabbit AI is a tool designed to help researchers and academics navigate and discover relevant literature efficiently. It uses AI algorithms to map out connections between research papers, enabling users to find related work, identify trends, and explore new research areas. It also creates article summaries, but don’t depend on the summaries being 100% accurate!

1. Let's do a search in ResearchRabbit on the same topic this time by adding one or two articles on the topic of your choice.
  - Open [ResearchRabbit]([https://elicit.com/](https://researchrabbitapp.com/)){:target="_blank"}, and if you want to use it you'll need to create an account.
  - Click the green **Add Papers** button, and then type the following into the search bar and click the search button:
<br>```Informal credentialling academic makerspaces```<br>
2. Reflection time:
>  - Do the suggested "Similar Work", "Earlier Work", and "Later Work" look relevant and useful?
>  - Does the network map of articles look like it might be helpful for you in your research?
>  - How useful do the articles look informal credentialling for academic makerspace skills in student job searches?
>  - Overall does this look like a tool that could help you with your research?

## Semantic Scholar - Article Summaries
Semantic Scholar uses GenAI tools to create summaries of journal articles, but don’t depend on the summaries being 100% accurate! Semantic Scholar summaries are typically better than general GenAI tool summaries but can still “make stuff up” so you still need to make your own summaries for articles you'll directly use in your research

1. Let's do a keyword search in Semantic Scholar on a topic of interest.
  - Open [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/){:target="_blank"} (no need to create an account unless you want to).
  - Type the following into the search bar and click the search button:
<br>```Informal credentialling academic makerspaces```<br>
2. Reflection time:
>  - How useful do the articles look informal credentialling for academic makerspace skills in student job searches?
>  - Do the article summaries look reasonable?
>  - How can you verify the accuracy of the summary?
>  - Does this look like a tool that could help you with your research?

## Elicit - Summaries of Top 4 Articles
Elicit AI is a research assistant tool that utilizes natural language processing to help users extract insights from academic papers and data. It makes a consolidated summary of the top 4 papers on the topic (in its judgment) and gives you links to 8 other related papers. Don’t depend on the summaries being 100% accurate!

1. Let's do a search in Elicit on the same topic this time using more natual language.
  - Open [Elicit](https://elicit.com/){:target="_blank"}, and if you want to use it you'll need to create an account.
  - Type the following into the search bar and click the search button:
<br>```How useful is informal credentialling for academic makerspace skills in student job searches?```<br>
2. Reflection time:
>  - How useful do the articles look informal credentialling for academic makerspace skills in student job searches?
>  - Does the combined 4 article summary look reasonable?
>  - How can you verify the accuracy of the summary?
>  - Does this look like a tool that could help you with your research?
