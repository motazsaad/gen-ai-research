<img src="images/7-gpt4all-animation.gif" style="float:right;width:520px;" alt="GPT4All in action!">
If you have any questions or get stuck as you work through this GPT4All exercise, please ask the instructor for assistance.  Have fun!

## Installing GPT4All on Your Laptop
GPT4All is "a free-to-use, locally running, privacy-aware Large Language Model (LLM) chatbot" ([GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html){:target="_blank"}, 2024). GPT4All like other large language models can:

Let's get started installing and using GPT4All for basic tasks!

1. **Download GPT4All** onto your laptop. Please select the link for your operating system:
- [Mac Download](https://gpt4all.io/installers/gpt4all-installer-darwin.dmg){:target="_blank"}
<br>-OR-
- [Windows Download](https://gpt4all.io/installers/gpt4all-installer-win64.exe){:target="_blank"}
2. **Install GPT4All** on your laptop:

  - Next, double-click on the _gpt4all-installer-darwin_ file and follow the installation instructions.
  - If you have any problems with the installation process, please ask your instructor for assistance.
- **Windows Install**: 
  - After downloading the installer, double-click on it.
  - Next, double-click on the _gpt4all-installer-win64_ file and follow the installation instructions.
  - If you have any problems with the installation process, please ask your instructor for assistance.

## Install a Language Model into GPT4All
Now we have _GPT4All_ installed on your laptop, we need to install a large language model before you can start asking it questions. There are a dozen or more models to choose from, but for now, we'll install one of the best overall models (as of Summer 2024) which is the _Llama 3 Instruct_ model. 
<img src="images/7-download-models.png" style="float:right;width:280px;" alt="Download Models button">
1. Click on the green **Download models** button in the middle of the windows.
2. Take a look at all the models available to download, and then click on the green **Install** button beside the _Llama 3 Instruct_ model description.
> _Note: The download is quite large at 4.3GB so it may take a while for it to download. For this model, GPT4All recommends that your computer have at least 8GB of memory for your computer to run the model at a reasonable speed._ If you have any questions about this please ask your instructor.
4. Once the model has finished downloading, click on the green **X** in the top right to close the "Discover and Download Models" window. Next, you can get down to business and start testing the language model's accuracy and speed!

## Test GPT4All's Accuracy & Speed
1. Let's test _GPT4All & Llama 3 Instruct_ with a generic prompt to start with. Copy and paste the following text into the Send a Message field and review the results:<br>
```Why would someone want to attend the University of Victoria in Canada? Why might the university not be a good fit for someone? Provide citations.```<br>
<img src="images/7-first-prompt.png" style="width:600px;" alt="First prompt">
  - How reasonable do the results look to you?
  - Do you notice any significant omissions from the "not be a good fit" section? Housing availability? Cost of living?
3. Now let's test GPT4All with something you know a lot about.
- For Example, personal questions might be good place to start if there was enough information on the public internet for the language models to train on: ```What is Rich McCue from the University of Victoria known for?```
- Another good way to test GPT3
  
## Install and Test another Language Model
1. If you haven't already, please [**open Microsoft Copilot**](https://copilot.microsoft.com/){:target="_blank"}. If you are a UVic student you can use a version of Copilot licensed for you by UVic by logging on with your UVic email address (e.g. _noahsmith@uvic.ca_). The UVic version of Copilot runs on servers located in Canada and does not share any of the prompts you create with Microsoft, or resulting data for training data, which is great from a privacy perspective.
